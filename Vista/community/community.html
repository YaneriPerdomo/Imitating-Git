                                There is also Git user mailing list on Google Groups which is a nice place for beginners to ask about anything. If you're a downstream packager of Git, consider joining the Git packagers mailing list for low-volume announcements from the developers, as well as other discussion related to packaging & porting Git.</p>

                                <p>Bugs in git can be reported directly to the mailing list (see above for details). Note that you do not need to
                                 subscribe to the list to send to it. You can help us out by attempting to reproduce the bug in the latest released
                                 version of git, or if you're willing to build git from source, the next branch. Sometimes an attempted fix may be pending in this branch, in which case your feedback as to whether the fix worked for you will be appreciated.

                                </p>

                                <p>If you are using git 2.27.0 or later, you can run git bugreport in the repository where you observed the bug, which generates a template to guide you through writing a useful bug report and gathers some diagnostic information about your environment.
